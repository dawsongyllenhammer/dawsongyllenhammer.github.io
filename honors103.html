                <p>
                    The two main texts I’ll be addressing in my written and visual research are <u>Meditations</u>  (written by Marcus Aurelius, translated by Gregory Hays) and also <u>The Passions of Perpetua and Felicity</u> (written by Vibia Perpetua, Translated by Thomas J. Heffernan). <br><br>

The primary object of Inquiry I was interested in is how these two texts discuss dreams and dream states. From this interest I developed the following research questions: <br><br>

1)How do these ancient texts play with the boundary of being awake and dreaming? <br><br>

2)In what ways do dreams distort reality? <br><br>

3)How do dreams alter the expectations and perceptions of the characters? <br><br>

                <h1>ASSUMPTIONS</h1>
                <p>
                    We must start by addressing that our relationship with dreams now is far different than it was in the past. According to simplistic generalizations about neuroscience, we now know that our brains experience dreams during Rapid Eye Movement/REM sleep.<sup>1</sup> According to this scientific theory,  REM sleep “is as much a preparation for waking consciousness as a reaction to it.”<sup>1</sup> This explanation entails that dreams serve as a way for the human brain to interpret the world we experience while we are awake. Dreams also serve as a mode for the brain to maintain readiness and alertness, so that one returns to the waking world rejuvenated.<sup>1</sup> It’s worth noting that even in this modern explanation, the essential interactive nature between dreams and reality is noticeable.
<br><br> Though this explanation for dreams is technically correct, there can be a trickle-down effect from such a purely empirical ideology. From my experience, a lot of scientific explanations for complex phenomena tend to revolve around reductionism, or the idea of breaking down extremely complex processes into simple and fundamental components.<sup>2</sup> However, though this philosophy can be used to ground complex human experiences in the physical biological components of our brains,<sup>2</sup> it consequently leaves out any explanation for the more human/subjective components of a dream, such as the emotional and psychological effect of a vivid dream experience. As a result, I’ve found that people I’ve met who are very keen on reductionist-based scientific explanation tend to put significantly less weight on their dream experiences. However, based off of our readings in this class, reductionism was far less rampant in ancient Greece than it is now. Instead, I (and the larger classroom, respectfully) assessed that theology was the primary way in which people assessed their experience.
<br><br> At first, I’d imagined just how disorienting and strange it must have been to experience such an emotionally moving dream in ancient Greece, when there was no simple and scientific explanation for how dreams worked. However, after assessing how I was projecting modern knowledge onto ancient times, I realized that reductionism wasn’t a common way of interpreting the world in ancient Greece. In fact, many people in ancient Greece likely expected religious messages in their dreams, which consequently made the experience of intensely moving dreams far more expected and valued in that society. <br><br>

                <h1>MEDITATIONS EXAMPLES</h1>
                <p>
                    In Meditations, the text takes a wide variety of approaches to dreams, and it usually comes up within the larger stoic context of disciplining your mind.<sup>3</sup> In teaching 27, it explains how to handle people that throw insults at you. It explains that you should not strain to impress them, and then adds, “But you do have to wish him well. He’s your closest relative. The gods assist him just as they do you—by signs and dreams and every other way—to get the things he wants (Hays 123).” Here, Marcus Aurelius’ satisfies my initial hypothesis that the theology of Greek mythology was used as a mode to assess dream experiences. Aurelius insists that dreams act as a form of holy prophecy, or a platform of consciousness where the gods can communicate with mortals directly.<sup>3</sup> Its also intriguing that dream-prophecies occurred universally, beyond any social class structure.<sup>3</sup> This lesson indicates to me that dreams are distinct from reality when it comes to perception. However, when it comes to the moral concepts of action and duty, the lessons/ meanings of a dream are intended to carry over into the waking world, for it is foolish to not act on the assistance that god provides.
<br><br> One of the most mind-bending quotes from meditations regarding dreams is found in lesson 31. It takes a completely different approach on how to assess dreams. The quote states, “Awaken; return to yourself. Now, no longer asleep, knowing they were only dreams, clear-headed again, treat everything around you as a dream (Hays 76).” This quote doesn’t explicitly address dreams from the context of theology. Instead, it encourages the reader (initially Aurelius) to actively attempt to distort reality.<sup>3</sup> In this case, Aurelius advocates to treat the real world as a dream, primarily for the sake of trying to distinctly separate your internal self from the external world.<sup>3</sup> I find this interesting, for it implies there is an existential feeling of detachment that is present when one enters a dream world. I furthermore found it interesting how Aurelius insists that we should actively change the lens in which we see reality. This “lens” indicates that our perceptions in a dream state are distinctly different yet still applicable as a mode of discipline for your mind when in a waking state. 
<br><br> Another interesting note about dreaming comes when Marcus Aurelius seems to be chastising himself for not following his own advice.<sup>3</sup>  He writes, “Every day they blot out those sacred principles of yours— which you daydream thoughtlessly about, or just let slide. Your actions and perceptions need to aim: • at accomplishing practical ends (Hays 135).” I thought this was interesting because, though daydreaming isn’t explicitly an unconscious state, It’s about as blurry as it gets when it comes to the separation between dream and reality. A daydream in this case is arguably a subtle imaginary moment where the mind is distracting itself from reality, in either an intentional or unintentional act of escapism. Clearly, Aurelius’ daydreams seem to haunt him,<sup>3</sup> and it indicates to me that the Greeks (or at the very least this ancient author) were aware of how dream states in some ways reflected out own dissatisfactions with ourselves. It begs the question; when in a legitimate REM dream state; were the Greeks ever aware of how subjective and personalized their dreams were? Did they ever see dreams as an extension of their personal anxieties and perceived imperfections? How would this realization reflect the perceived divinity of the dream state? 
<br><br> One of the most insightful moments that Marcus Aurelius mentions dreams is when he is quoting Heraclitus.<sup>3</sup> He is quoted to have said, “‘Our words and actions should not be like those of sleepers’ (for we act and speak in dreams as well) ‘or of children copying their parents’—doing and saying only what we have been told (Hays 47).’” This lesson creates a lot of interesting comparisons that are worth unpacking. In the first half, he is referring to sleepers in a negative light, using sleepers as a synonym for mindlessness.<sup>3</sup> He is ushering us to live a more goal-driven and intentional lifestyle, where your intentions are clear and you actions are never aimless.<sup>3</sup> However, he suddenly spins the meaning around and shows the thin film between dream and reality. By noting that we speak and sleep in dreams just as we do in the day,<sup>3</sup> He is casually noting this massive implication that dreams serve as a parallel reality where people can operate in extremely complex and nuanced ways, just like the waking world. He suddenly raises the question of whether we should treat these worlds as separate, especially if the way we operate inside these two worlds is so similar. Then, in the second half he compares the dream state to children mindlessly following their parents.<sup>3</sup>  This again demeans the sleeping world to an aimless exploration, and I’d argue the wandering nature of dreams conflicted with the Stoic perception of a determined mind.<sup>3</sup> But at the same time, Why is he so fast to treat dreams as childish when the common perception was that dreams were holy interventions with the self? These contradictions were likely a result of the text being an unpolished personal diary.

                <h1>PERPETUA &amp; FELICITY EXAMPLES</h1>
                <p>
                    The Passions of Perpetua and Felicity quite clearly address dreams as a theological process.<sup>4</sup> In teaching I, Perpetua quotes the lord to have said “I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh; and their sons and daughters shall prophesy; … and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams.” (Heffernan 1). Here, in the most explicit way imaginable, Perpetua states that both dreams and visions are theological prophecies coming directly from the spirit of the Lord.<sup>4</sup> However, it’s interesting how the author poses a separation between visions and dreams, which is distinctly separated by the young and the old.<sup>4</sup> From here you could interpret this as saying that visions require far more alertness and presence, and consequently are the way the youth can feel the touch of god. It then indicates that dreams are more mindless and lazy, more fit for the old and frail who lack a certain alertness. However, the way these two forms of holy are expressed right next to each other implies their inherent similarity as a divine distortion where the real world becomes (in varying degrees) half-morphed into a pseudo-religious dimension. To define “visions,” I personally perceive visions in this case as a form of daydream. However, the word daydream connotates both mindlessness and mundanity to it, whereas a vision is a particular form of daydream that is both deeply imaginative, and also has an individual (or collective) perceived importance to it. In the context of the Christian faith, a vision is far more holy than a daydream, that was seen as a much clearer message from God.
	<br><br> Since this book very explicitly describes multiple complex visions sequences, for the sake of this exploration I will focus on one particular vision; the ladder. It begins with teaching IV, where Felicity writes“’ Then my brother said to me: ‘Lady my sister, you are now greatly esteemed, so much so that you might ask for a vision, and it may be shown to you whether there will be suffering or freedom.’ And I, who knew that I was able to speak with the Lord, …, confidently promised him, saying: ‘Tomorrow, I will tell you.(Heffernan 127)’” This quote very wonderfully outlines the way the Christian faith (or at least this particular ancient Christian) views dreams. It seems like its implied that one’s ability to see visions is a currency with which one can display their closeness to god. To experience visions/vivid daydreams, one had to valiantly follow the holy path, which infers that visions are a way to reward those who are much farther down that path. This quote also indicates that holy direction isn’t universal, but instead hierarchical, as it favors those further down a linear progression to godliness. I do find it interesting how this concept relates to escapism. While simple daydreaming is a mode of escaping mundane reality, visions are a much more potent experience that likely hint at the afterlife. After all, isn’t the afterlife the ultimate escapism from reality, where you literally enter another world? No wonder dreams and the afterlife are so paralleled, they so desperately want to escape the stability of the mortal plane.
	<br><br> Continuing teaching IV, Felicity begins to describe the vision in detail.<sup>4</sup> She says, “I see a bronze ladder of great length, reaching up to heaven, but so narrow that people could only climb up one at a time. And on the sides of the ladder, iron implements of every kind were attached. There were swords, lances, … so that if anyone climbed up carelessly, or not looking upwards, he was torn to pieces and his flesh clung to the iron weapons. (Heffernan 127)” The ladder here is implied to be a symbol of progress, again backing this perception of the path toward god being a linear path. This narrative is further established by the narrowness of the ladder,4 which infers that one can only make progress on the path on an individual scale. The many weapons in the way then appeal to the Christian narrative of suffering being a vital step in the path to righteousness. 4 What I find most interesting is that these collections of symbols are given a perceived value, particularly because they will apply directly to the real world. In other words, a visions lack of perceived absurdity came from its ability to effect reality and stimulate a change in the characters perceptions or fundamental actions down the road. 
	<br><br> The full repercussion of her beliefs occur when Felicity describes the vision to her brother.<sup>4</sup> Afterwards she writes, “And we knew we would suffer, and we ceased to have any hope in this world (Heffernan 127).’”
            This quote bookends teaching 4,<sup>4</sup> and it blatantly shows the repercussions of treating dreams as a rulebook to move toward a more divine reality.  Not only is Felicities actions altered dramatically from this divine weight, but also her general outlook on life now turns to glorifying pain for the sake of faithful sacrifice.<sup>4</sup>

                <h1>DEFENDING THE MEDIUM</h1>
                <p>
                    The purpose of the painting I made is to visually display my text analysis, while also building upon it towards a more interpretive claim. I decided to assess this inquiry in the painting format because I see dreams as an intensely visual experience. I also think that there’s a sort of subtlety to painting symbols. The beauty of an image is that you can interpret it in a much more diverse way. Based off my experience as a painter, I personally feel like the assumptions we bring have a much heavier weight when deducing the meaning of images as opposed to words. While in written text you can follow along with a line of inquiry in a very linear way, a painting is much less obligated to hold your hand through the process. Instead, you are thrown onto the canvas with very little direction, and consequently, interpretation becomes far more potent. The main drawback of the painting medium is that the answer to the research question is less explicit. However, I think that diverse interpretation aids with the question at hand because dream interpretation is a deeply subjective process, and I feel that the depth of a dreams relationship with reality will have more impact if visually explored. 
                    <br><br> On another note, though the medium of the website is much less pertinent to my research, the reason I made a website was because It is the best way I know to visually organize text and images in a comprehensive and professional manner. Furthermore, in the written portion of this project, I decided to write a somewhat informal essay style, which uses “I” frequently. I wrote like this because I find the path of inquiry to be a very personal one, and it seems much more organic to present my analysis in first person since the way I interpret these quotes is rooted in my own subjective experiences and interests. <br><br>

                    Though I want to leave room for the viewer to interpret things as they may, I think it’s worth it to provide some scaffolding that might help with connecting to the piece easier.

<br><br>-This painting is pretty color-coded. The “blue” section on the right side of the screen, which is overlaying over the figures body, is a representation of normal, conscious, and waking reality. The pinker areas are meant to represent the realm of dreams, visions and daydreams. The greenish teal ground holds a bit more ambiguity. Finally, the white shapes represent the figures perceptions and observations from the environment surrounding her.

<br><br>-I do realize that in teaching IV of The Passions of Perpetua and Felicity, a serpent is present in the holy vision beneath the ladder <sup>4</sup>. I intentionally left this out of the painting, and in place of the serpent is a man’s shadow holding a star symbol.

<br><br>-There are various other symbols scattered about the layout. Their placement on the different “realms” is intentional, but the symbols are not entirely separate ideas. They are able to interact with eachother.
