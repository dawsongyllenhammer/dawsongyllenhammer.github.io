                    Hello! My name is Dawson Gyllenhammer and i'm a digital and traditional artist based in Bellingham, Washington. I am also studying Design,
                    Web Design, and Web Development as a student at Western  Washington University. <br> <br>
                    When it comes to my work, I consider my artwork to meddle somewhere in between Surrealism and Psychadellia. I also have an obsession with symbols. 
                    I realize that every visual element has some sort of contextual weight to it, And I like to place different symbols sets within a composition 
                    to see how meaning is distorted by them. I'm a huge fan of symbols like cigarettes, lighters, sculptures, crosses, revolvers, moons and knives.<br> <br>
                    Some of my work is really just technical studies, but with my (slightly) more creative pieces, my process seems to come from mostly my subconcious. I rarely ever have a meaning, theme, or sketch planned out before 
                    I paint. Instead, I choose symbols at random that I feel will fit the composition, and as a result my ideation is pretty unpredictable, even to me. I like it this way though; Its like an emotional roller coaster thats pretty rewarding in the end. <br> <br>
                    I've also found that my interests change pretty vastly over time. my current goal has been to develop my paintings more fully, and really go in on the details. I want to end up with a composition thats more than just portrait + random object. But its gonna take a while before I get there. <br> <br>
                    If your interested in a commission, or you just wanna talk about the creative process, feel free to visit my Contact page (or just <br><a href="mailto:dawsonartworks@gmail.com">E-mail Me</a>) <br> <br>
